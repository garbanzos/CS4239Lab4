**Choice 1**

The first choice is a heap use after free error. There was an attempt to write to `p` after it is freed. Use after free is a memory error because it can lead to undefined behavior. For example, it can lead of corruption memory because the freed memory may have been allocated to a subsequent variable and writing to the `p` can corrupt the data of this subsequent variable. The heap use after free error can be detected by ASAN because it poisoned the freed memory region and put the freed memory region into quarantine. Hence, when we try to access `p` after it is freed, an error is raised by ASAN.

**Choice 2**

The second choice is a stack buffer overflow. There is an attempt to access `buffer[22]` which is out of bounds of `buffer` that is an local array with only 10 elements. Stack buffer overflow can be used by a malicious user to overwrite the return address of functions and hijack the control flow of programs. This can be detected by ASAN because it poisoned the red zones around the `buffer` array. Hence, when we try to access `buffer[22]` which is in the red zone, an error is raised by ASAN.

**Choice 3**

The third choice is a double free error. There is an attempt to free `p` after it has already been freed. Double free (or multiple free) is an memory error as it can lead to undefined behavior (that may vary from OS to OS). This memory error can be detected by ASAN as it poisoned the freed memory region and put the freed memory region into quarantine. Hence, when we try to free `p` after it has been freed, an error is raised by ASAN.
