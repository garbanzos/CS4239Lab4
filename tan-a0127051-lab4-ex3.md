**Choice 1**


**Choice 2**

ASAN is unable to detect out of bounds memory access that is beyond the red zones of a variable and land in a "non-red zone" of another variable. In choice 2, there is an attempt to access `a[66]` which is out of bounds of `a` (`a` only have 8 elements). However, this is not detected by ASAN because the memory access happens to land on somewhere inside array `b`, which is not a red zone.

**Choice 3**

ASAN is unable to detect some use after free memory access when a large amount of memory was `malloc()`-ed and `free()`-ed between the `free()` of `c` and the subsequent use of it. Use after free is a memory error because it can lead to undefined behavior and cause effects such as memory corruption. In choice 3, there is an attempt to use `c` after it is freed. However, this is not detected by ASAN because the allocating and deallocating of the large amounts of memory causes the freed memory region of `c` to be released from the free quarantine queue of ASAN. As a result, when we try to use `c` after it is freed, there is no error raised by ASAN.
